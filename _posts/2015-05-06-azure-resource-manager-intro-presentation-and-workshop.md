I attended the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Perth-Cloud/events/221691559/" target="_blank">Azure Saturday</a> event here in Perth last weekend. <a href="http://mdavies.net/" target="_blank">Matt</a> and I did a basic introÂ presentation on Azure Resource Manager and ran an associated workshop, which we have <a href="https://github.com/MRCollective/AzureResourceManager_MicrosoftAzureSaturdayPerth2015" target="_blank">published to our GitHub organisation</a>.

Azure Resource Manager is one of the most important things to understand about Azure if you plan on using it since it&#8217;s the platform thatÂ underpins the provisioning and management of all resources in Azure going forward.
