I attended the [Azure Saturday](http://www.meetup.com/Perth-Cloud/events/221691559/) event here in Perth last weekend. [Matt](http://mdavies.net/) and I did a basic intro presentation on Azure Resource Manager and ran an associated workshop, which we have [published to our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/MRCollective/AzureResourceManager_MicrosoftAzureSaturdayPerth2015).



Azure Resource Manager is one of the most important things to understand about Azure if you plan on using it since it's the platform that underpins the provisioning and management of all resources in Azure going forward.
