Last month I completedÂ <a href="https://vaughnvernon.co/" target="_blank">Vaughn Vernon</a>â€˜s 3-day advanced IDDD Workshop. Here are some notes I&#8217;ve since written up about the main points I got out of it after re-reviewing the course material. Some <a href="http://gurustop.net/blog/2014/01/19/my-notes-from-vaughn-vernon-s-iddd-workshop-ddd-saasovation-agile-pm/" target="_blank">notes from a colleague who attended the same course</a> have also been published.

## Getting started with DDD

  * DDD is the formation of a ubiquitous language explicitly bound by a â€œbounded contextâ€ &#8211; the context is important because the same word can have different meanings
  * Hexagonal architecture / ports and adapters can be used with DDD &#8211; there are adapters from the domain to a port (either input or output &#8211; could be datasources or other systems)
  * DDD should be used in situations for complex/unknown applications and problem domains that provide a competitive advantage &#8211; it is a technique to help uncover these complexities over time in a sustainable way 
      * If CRUD is more appropriate &#8211; use CRUD
      * Keep in mind that investing in the code generally pays off over the long term
  * DDD can be used with legacy code, but you need to abstract and encapsulate the parts of the legacy code you arenâ€™t modelling
  * DDD is about bridging the gap between technical people and subject matter experts so finding the subject matter experts (they arenâ€™t necessarily your product owner and there might be multiple ones) is important &#8211; where possible interact with them directly for best effect
  * A ubiquitous language should include the terms as well as scenarios that describe the context of those â€œthingsâ€
  * Good general rule: Tell, donâ€™t ask (tell objects what you want to do, donâ€™t ask them for data)

## Domains, subdomains, bounded contexts

  * Subdomains &#8211; identify the pieces of information you need for your project to be successful 
      * Where possible have a one to one mapping with a bounded context unless there is a small shared kernel
  * Bounded context contains: interfaces (service or UI), app services, database schema, domain itself
  * Example: pull out user and identity into separate domain, then you can model more explicit things that might be mapped from that context e.g. Author, Collaborator (these could even just be a value object with an id that links to the other context)
  * For each domain look at what domains it (core) is linked to and identify them as: supporting or generic

## Context maps / relationships between subdomains

  * It can help to draw context maps to illustrate where the subdomains, contexts and the relationships between them are
  * Ways of joining two separate (sub)domains: 
      * Partnership
      * Shared kernel
      * Customer-supplier
      * Conformist
  * When communicating with another domain (via OHS, web service, messaging): 
      * ACL
      * Published language
      * Event subscription

## Architecture

  * Ports and adapters, {infra -> UI -> application -> domain}, CQRS/ES, event-driven are some of the architectural options 
      * Ports donâ€™t have to model the domain e.g. UserInRole REST service even though there is no UserInRole domain object)
      * Adapters can map to/from domain representation e.g. UserInRoleAdapter
      * Ports and adapters allow you to focus on the domain, delay infrastructure concerns and do separate testing
  * Domain services shouldnâ€™t control security (where itâ€™s a cross-cutting concern as opposed to something being modelled) or transactions

## Entities / Value objects

  * Use entities to model things that you care about individuality 
      * Equality via id
      * Avoid just doing sets &#8211; if you have two sets in a row then you are probably missing a behaviour &#8211; ask yourself if you missed a set would you be in an inconsistent state?
      * Ensure consistency by using invariants and non-default constructors
  * Use value objects where possible to model things that describe, measure, qualify or quantify the ubiquitous language &#8211; should model a conceptual whole 
      * Generally immutable, set state via ctor &#8211; makes it easy to test and maintain 
          * Modification methods should return a new instance
      * Equality by comparing properties
      * Discardable, replaceable and interchangeable
      * If you want you can use value objects to represent the id of a particular entity (e.g. wrap guid)
  * Generating identities 
      * User provides
      * Application generates
      * Persistence store generates
      * Anther bounded context provides

## Aggregates

  * Main purpose: determine transactional boundaries for consistency
  * Balance between having a large aggregate graph that gives navigational convenience, but can result in higher likelihood of transactional errors that donâ€™t affect consistency / negative size and performance impacts vs small aggregates that might mean a lot of messing about in application code to wrangle multiple aggregates
  * Keep in mind eventual consistency &#8211; do multiple aggregates have to be kept consistent? 
      * event processing / batch processing etc. &#8211; get business to specify the max time to be consistent
  * Where possible reference between aggregates by id &#8211; less memory, faster to load, better garbage collection
  * Can use double dispatch from an application service to pass instances between aggregates to perform actions
  * Domain events are non-async 
      * This means you can respond to a domain event within the same transaction
      * You can have a listener that then publishes the events to a bus (and from there they can be handled async)
      * Who job is it to make the data consistent? 
          * If the end user then use transaction consistency if another user or the system then eventual consistency should be fine

## Domain Services

  * A domain service is a part of the domain model that is a non-transactional, lightweight stateless operation that doesnâ€™t have a natural home in an entity 
      * If you find yourself using static methods in your domain entities then itâ€™s a good indicator that you need a domain service
      * They can be passed into models and used via double dispatch or the model can be passed into them

## Domain Events

  * Domain events inform subscribers of the facts about past happenings in a bounded context
  * When domain experts use triggering works then itâ€™s a good sign you might need a domain event: 
      * When
      * If that happens
      * Inform me if
      * Notify me if
      * An occurrence of
  * You can persist events along with state (or just the events if using event sourcing)
  * Events can be published outside of the bounded context or processed asynchronously by forwarding them to a message exchange 
      * Bus
      * Decoupled publishing e.g. atom feed
  * Event-driven modelling exercise &#8211; Trello is a good example 
      * Good example to do with a domain expert as a first step to fleshing out a domain
      * Leads to a good model if you plan on using event sourcing
      * 1. Model the events in time order (verb, past tense)
      * 2. Model the commands that would create the events (imperative exhortation)
      * 3. Model the aggregates that would participate in the command/event (noun)

## Modules (namespaces)

  * Name the modules as per the ubiquitous language (e.g. aggregates or concepts to group an aggregate)
  * Can have child namespaces e.g. concept -> aggregate
  * Donâ€™t create modules based on type of component (e.g. include services with the entities)
  * Try not to couple between modules and where there are dependencies try and use acyclic graphs

## Factories

  * Where possible construct objects inside of domain services and entities so the ubiquitous language is expressed
  * If you have all the parameters and the construction is simple itâ€™s ok to new up an object in an app service
