I've given a couple of presentations recently and I've uploaded the slidedecks and YouTube videos of them as per below:


- ["Moving from Technical Agility to Strategic Agility"](https://github.com/robdmoore/MovingFromTechnicalAgilityToStrategicAgilityPresentation) - a joint talk by myself and Jess Panni to Agile Perth
- ["Push better software with Pull Requests presentation"](https://github.com/robdmoore/PushBetterSoftwareWithPullRequestsPresentation) - a presentation I gave to the [Yow! West conference](http://west.yowconference.com.au/)
