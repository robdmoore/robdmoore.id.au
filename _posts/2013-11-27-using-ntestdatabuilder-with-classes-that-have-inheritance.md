If you are building test data using the [NTestDataBuilder library](/blog/2013/05/26/announcing-ntestdatabuilder-library/ "Announcing NTestDataBuilder library") I released and you are dealing with classes that have an inheritance chain then you might want to have a base builder class that abstracts common properties.



I've created a gist that explains how to achieve this with two different options at:Â [https://gist.github.com/robdmoore/7671127](https://gist.github.com/robdmoore/7671127).



Enjoy!
