This week I made a presentation to the Perth .NET user group about the content in my [test fixture data generation](/blog/2013/05/26/test-data-generation-the-right-way-object-mother-test-data-builders-nsubstitute-nbuilder/ "Test Data Generation the right way: Object Mother + Test Data Builders + NSubstitute + NBuilder")Â post. As part of that I created some [sample code](https://github.com/robdmoore/TestFixtureDataGenerationPresentation) that illustrates the outcome that each of the different techniques I outline in my post post might look - if you are interested in exploring these techniques or seeing some somewhat realistic examples of using the NTestDataBuilder library then I encourage you to take a look.



Furthermore, I've just released version 1.0 of the NTestDataBuilder library - my team has been successfully using it for a number of weeks now and I'm happy with the functionality in it.



Enjoy!
