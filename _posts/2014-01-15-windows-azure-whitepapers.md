My latest whitepaper for my employer, <a href="http://readify.net/" target="_blank">Readify</a>, has been published. That makes two whitepapers I&#8217;ve written now.

  * <a href="http://readify.net/insights/whitepapers/cloud-and-windows-azure-introduction/" target="_blank">Cloud and Windows Azure Introduction<br /> </a>Cloud Computing is an often talked about and often misunderstood phenomenon. While many people disagree about what it is, most people agree that it is a revolutionary shift in the way computing resources are consumed and delivered and will have a big impact on the future. This paper consists of two parts; firstly, it discusses what cloud computing is, what benefits cloud computing can deliver to your business and what things to look out for when making a decision about cloud computing. The second part of the paper gives an overview of the Microsoft Windows Azure cloud computing platform and outlines the benefits that it can deliver to your business.
  * <a href="http://readify.net/insights/whitepapers/developing-and-deploying-web-applications-in-windows-azure/" target="_blank">Azure Web Apps: Developing and Deploying Web Applications in Windows Azure<br /> </a>When deploying web applications in Windows Azure there are a number of options available to you. It&#8217;s not always immediately clear from the documentation which of the options are the right ones to use in any given situation.This whitepaper will explain the three main options that are available in Windows Azure to deploy web applications and will cover the similarities and differences between them in order to make the decision of which to use easier. It will also cover the different deployment strategies available to you after you have made the decision.
