I&#8217;ve just pushed a new version of <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NQUnit" target="_blank">NQUnit</a> and <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NQUnit.NUnit" target="_blank">NQUnit.NUnit</a> (1.0.5). This update updates the libraries to use the latest version of Watin, NUnit, jQuery and QUnit.Â I&#8217;ve also made some documentation improvements. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/robdmoore/NQUnit" target="_blank">latest code and documentation on GitHub</a>.

It&#8217;s worth noting that while NQUnit still works perfectly well, there is a better option that I usually recommend in preference: <a href="http://chutzpah.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Chutzpah</a>. I&#8217;ve updated NQUnit as per pull requests that the library received &#8211; while there are still people using the library I&#8217;m happy to keep it up to date.
