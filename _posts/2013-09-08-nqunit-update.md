I've just pushed a new version of [NQUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NQUnit) and [NQUnit.NUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NQUnit.NUnit) (1.0.5). This update updates the libraries to use the latest version of Watin, NUnit, jQuery and QUnit.Â I've also made some documentation improvements. You can see the [latest code and documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/robdmoore/NQUnit).



It's worth noting that while NQUnit still works perfectly well, there is a better option that I usually recommend in preference: [Chutzpah](http://chutzpah.codeplex.com/). I've updated NQUnit as per pull requests that the library received - while there are still people using the library I'm happy to keep it up to date.
