Hi all,

Just a quick note that the videos for the presentations I delivered with Matt Davies at NDC Sydney 2016 are up:

  * [Microtesting: How We Set Fire To The Testing Pyramid While Ensuring Confidence](https://vimeo.com/189830215)
  * [Modern Authentication](https://vimeo.com/200279525)

It was an amazing conference to attend, let alone present at and I&#8217;m looking forward to this year&#8217;s conference!
