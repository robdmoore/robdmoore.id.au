Hi all,



Just a quick note that the videos for the presentations I delivered with Matt Davies at NDC Sydney 2016 are up:


- [Microtesting: How We Set Fire To The Testing Pyramid While Ensuring Confidence](https://vimeo.com/189830215)
- [Modern Authentication](https://vimeo.com/200279525)



It was an amazing conference to attend, let alone present at and I'm looking forward to this year's conference!
