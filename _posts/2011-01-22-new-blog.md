So I&#8217;m starting a new blog, which is something that I have been planning to do for quite a while now.

I collect a lot of technical knowledge through my work and side-projects and I feel that this, combined with the fact I enjoy teaching people, leads to a good starting point for a blog. So I plan to disseminate my knowledge and experience through this blog and consequently reach a larger audience than I do during my day-to-day life. It will also serve as a good portfolio of sorts to compliment my CV (at least much better than my current website, which I did 5 years ago and will soon be redirecting to this blog!).

So hopefully you enjoy what I have to say, or at least it raises debate and discussion (I love learning new things and considering different opinions so if I&#8217;m ever wrong or you have a completely different view point let me know!).
