I recently gave a presentation with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/jesspanni" target="_blank">Jess Panni</a>Â to the <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/branches/western-australia/events/past-event-presentations/event-details?eveID=20274765132648" target="_blank">ACS WA Conference</a>Â about Agile and where we see it heading in the next 5-10 years. When offered the speaking slot the requirements were that it involved data analytics in some way and that it wasn&#8217;t the same old Agile stuff that everyone has been talking about for years, but rather something a bit different.Â Both of those requirements suited me because it fit in perfectly with thoughts I&#8217;d been having recently about Agile and where it is heading.

Jess and I had a lot of fun preparing the talk &#8211; it&#8217;s not often we get time to sit down and chat about process, research what the industry leaders are saying and brainstorm our own thoughts and experiences in light of that research. I&#8217;m very proud of the content that we&#8217;ve managed to assemble and the way we&#8217;ve structured it.

We paid particular care to make the slide deck useful for people &#8211; there are comprehensive notes on each slide and there are a bunch of relevant references at the end for further reading.

I&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/robdmoore/TechnicalToStrategicAgilityPresentation" target="_blank">put the slides up on GitHub</a> if you are interested.
