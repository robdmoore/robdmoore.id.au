Further to the blog post I posted yesterday about the approach to [generating test fixture data for automated tests](http://robdmoore.id.au/blog/2013/05/26/test-data-generation-the-right-way-object-mother-test-data-builders-nsubstitute-nbuilder/ "Test Data Generation the right way: Object Mother + Test Data Builders + NSubstitute + NBuilder") that my team has adopted I have open sourced a base class and other supporting code infrastructure to quickly, tersely and maintainably generate fixture data in a consistent way.



I have released this library to [GitHub](https://github.com/robdmoore/NTestDataBuilder) and [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/NTestDataBuilder/) under the name NTestDataBuilder.



The GitHub page has a bunch of code snippets that will get you started quickly. Read my previous blog post to get a feel for how I use the code and in particular how I combine the approach with the Object Mother pattern for best effect.



Enjoy!
