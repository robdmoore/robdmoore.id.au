I recently stumbled across the [Windows Azure Solution Cookbook](http://www.notsotrivial.net/blog/post/2012/07/02/Windows-Azure-Solution-Cookbook.aspx) by [Clint Edmonson](http://www.notsotrivial.net) from Microsoft. It's a pretty awesome set of reference architectures for solving a few different scenarios that Windows Azure is a natural fit for solving.



One of the things I noticed is that on the [lead-in page](http://www.notsotrivial.net/blog/post/2012/07/02/Windows-Azure-Solution-Cookbook.aspx) there is what I can only describe as the most amazing high-level diagram of Azure that I've been able to find to date. It wasn't quite up to date though, having been done before the release of Web Sites and Mobile Servies. I [recently asked Clint](https://twitter.com/robdmoore/status/243540431470747648) if he could do an updated version via the magic of Twitter and he has come through.



If you need to give any presentations about Azure or frankly, just want to see an example of all the different (and many!) components that make up Azure these days and how they fit into each other than [take a look](http://www.notsotrivial.net/blog/post/2012/09/10/Updated-Windows-Azure-Reference-Architecture.aspx)!
