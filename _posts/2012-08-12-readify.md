Just a quick post to say that I have left Curtin University and I'm now working for a very cool company called [Readify](http://readify.net/) as a Senior Consultant.



Readify won the [2012 Microsoft Software Development Partner of the Year Award](http://readify.net/who-we-are/news/2012/readify-win-the-2012-microsoft-software-development-partner-of-the-year-award) and has been on the [BRW top 50 Best Places to Work in Australia](http://readify.net/who-we-are/news/2012/readify-named-brws-27th-best-place-to-work-in-australia) list for the last three years running. To say I'm excited and humbled to be working for them is an understatement.



Readify has some **very** clever people working for it (I have already had the fortune to work with a couple of their consultants in the past, hence how I knew about them) and I'm extremely excited about all the amazing things I will learn working with them!



Curtin has been an excellent place to work and I will certainly treasure my time there :)
