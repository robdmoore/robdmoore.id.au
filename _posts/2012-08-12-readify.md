Just a quick post to say that I have left Curtin University and I&#8217;m now working for a very cool company called <a href="http://readify.net/" target="_blank">Readify</a> as a Senior Consultant.

Readify won the <a href="http://readify.net/who-we-are/news/2012/readify-win-the-2012-microsoft-software-development-partner-of-the-year-award" target="_blank">2012 Microsoft Software Development Partner of the Year Award</a> and has been on the <a href="http://readify.net/who-we-are/news/2012/readify-named-brws-27th-best-place-to-work-in-australia" target="_blank">BRW top 50 Best Places to Work in Australia</a> list for the last three years running. To say I&#8217;m excited and humbled to be working for them is an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understatement</span>.

Readify has some **very** clever people working for it (I have already had the fortune to work with a couple of their consultants in the past, hence how I knew about them) and I&#8217;m extremely excited about all the amazing things I will learn working with them!

Curtin has been an excellent place to work and I will certainly treasure my time there ðŸ™‚
