<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">If you can reason about the relationship between the input and the output, then as long as they are next to each other e.g. data-driven test then the test makes sense.</span></p>
<p>If, however, the relationship is more complex then it makes sense to use a derived value (mention the concept of equivalence classes). Â Possibly talk about benefits/disadvantages of using a different way of calculating?</p>
<p>Unit test more maintainable / easier to understand.</p>
<p>Important of TDD breaking step. Team that isn't disciplined.</p>
<p>Danger of using "same" code.</p>
<p>If it's slightly different it might be wrong.</p>
<p>Multiple tests - you can use a subset of the logic just for that test.</p>
<p>acceptance tests as a good example</p>
<p>extension method on date</p>
